<p align="center">
üéâFirst off All, thanks for taking the time out of your schedule and deciding to contribute here!üëç</p>


## Assistance to get started:page_facing_up:


If you're new to contributing and have no idea about working with repositories, be sure to check [GitHub docs to getting started](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/getting-started-with-github) from GitHub may also be helpful to refer.



This project aims to simplify and guide the way beginners make their first contribution. If you are looking to make your first contribution, follow the steps below.

_If you're not comfortable with command line, [here are tutorials using GUI tools.](#tutorials-using-other-tools)_

 

#### If you don't have git on your machine, [install it](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/).

## Fork this repository

Fork this repository by clicking on the fork button on the top of this page.
This will create a copy of this repository in your account.

## Clone the repository

Now clone the forked repository to your machine. Go to your GitHub account, open the forked repository, click on the code button and then click the _copy to clipboard_ icon.

Open a terminal and run the following git command:

```
git clone "url you just copied"
```

where "url you just copied" (without the quotation marks) is the url to this repository (your fork of this project). See the previous steps to obtain the url.

## Create a branch

Change to the repository directory on your computer (if you are not already there):

Now create a branch using the `git checkout` command:

```
git checkout -b your-new-branch-name
```

For example:

```
git checkout -b your_branch_name
```

## Make necessary changes and commit those changes

Now open the file, make the changes u want. Now, save the file.

If you execute the command `git status` on terminal(or git bash), you'll see there are changes.

Add those changes to the branch you just created using the `git add` command:

```
git add your_file_ name
```

Now commit those changes using the `git commit` command:

```
git commit -m "type a message describing your contribution or changes you made"
```


## Push changes to GitHub

Push your changes using the command `git push`:

```
git push origin add-your-branch-name
```

replacing  `add-your-branch-name` with the name of the branch you created earlier.

## Submit your changes for review

If you go to your repository on GitHub, you'll see a `Compare & pull request` button. Click on that button.

Now submit the pull request.

Soon I'll be merging all your changes into the master branch of this project. You will get a notification email once the changes have been merged.

## Where to go from here?

Congrats! You just completed the standard _fork -> clone -> edit -> pull request_ workflow that you'll encounter often as a contributor!

Celebrate your contribution and share it with your friends and followers.
